// Q14) Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guest_list = ['shahwaiz Tahir', 'Manzar abbas', 'Maaz', 'Basit', 'ahmed'];
for (var _i = 0, guest_list_1 = guest_list; _i < guest_list_1.length; _i++) {
    var guestname = guest_list_1[_i];
    console.log("".concat(guestname, ", initing them to dinner"));
}
