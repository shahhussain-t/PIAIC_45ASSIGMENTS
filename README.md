<br>

• Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.
<br>

• Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.</p>

<hr>

<h1>project016</h1>
<p>17.<b>Shrinking Guest List: </b> You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.
<br>
• Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.

<br>
• Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.
<br>
• Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.</p>

<br>

• Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it.
<br>

• Print your array in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.
<br>

• Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it again.
<br>

• Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that its order has changed.

<br>
