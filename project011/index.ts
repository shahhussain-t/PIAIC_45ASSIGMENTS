// Q12) Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

{

    let names:string[]=["Shahwaiz Tahir",'Manzar','Saifullah Ghori','Syed Maaz']
    
    
    console.log(`Hey,${names[0]} Eid Mubarak in Advanced`)
    console.log(`Hey,${names[1]} Eid Mubarak in Advanced`)
    console.log(`Hey,${names[2]} Eid Mubarak in Advanced`)
    console.log(`Hey,${names[3]} Eid Mubarak in Advanced`)
